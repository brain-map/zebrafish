# Introduction
This resource provides a partial connectome of the larval zebrafish hindbrain. The resource includes a high-resolution Electron Microscopy (EM) volume, proofread neuronal segmented volumes, and proofread synaptic contacts. The EM volume (of the right hindbrain) extends from roughly the level of the Mauthner axon to below the Abducens and from the obex through rhombomere 2. Proofread cell types of the oculomotor system include abducens motoneurons, abducens internuclear neurons, second-order vestibular neurons, and oculomotor integrator neurons. The data set also includes proofread cell types of the locomotor system like the giant reticulospinal neurons.   

Details of the imaging, reconstruction, and proofreading are described in [Vishwanathan et. al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217307303), [Wanner et. al](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00089/full).
