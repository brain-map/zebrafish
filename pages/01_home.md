# Introduction
The larval zebrafish dataset is from a 6dfp larvae described in the [Vishwanathan et. al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982217307303). The high-resolution Electron Microscipy (EM) volume over the hindbrain spans from the plane of the Mauthner Cell (M-cell), to roughly the inferior olive (IO). It contains most of the important cell-types that are involved in eye movement, including the Abducens motor neurons, neurons upstream of them, Reticulospinal neurons etc. 

# Science
The volume was collected from a larvae which was previoulsy imaged with calcium sensors during spontaneous eye-movements. For a detailed description please read the methods section of the above paper.

# Technology
The EM volume was colleced on a single-beam Zeiss Sigma from 45nm sices of the preserved hindbrain of the larval zebrafish. Details of tissue processing and microscopy are described in [Wanner et. al] (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00089/full).
